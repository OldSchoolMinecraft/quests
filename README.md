# Quests
When mostly complete, below is what will be available through this plugin.

## Areas
### Quests
#### Examples
- Break 10 sand blocks
- Place 10 sand blocks
- Kill 10 zombies
- Move 100 blocks
#### Description
Quests are something that a player can do. If they do happen to complete a quest, they are rewarded with XP (this will be mentioned later) or other types, such as items or balance. They can view their progress on quests with /quests. In a working system, these will be replaced weekly.
### Ranks
#### Examples
- Newbie (0xp, 0 play time)
- Adventurer (15xp, 2hrs of playtime)
- Veteran (100xp, 1 day of playtime, $250 in-game balance)
#### Description
Ranks are something that should be sort-of grindy, and rewarded with frequent gameplay. There should be enough ranks to not seem boring, but not too much that it may be overwhelming.
